Pokedex was my first API project, designed to help me begin to learn how to pull information from an API and then display it.

This was my first full solo project, built and pulling information from the Pokedex API. The start of the project was simply pulling the very first item.
After this was complete, I began to implement buttons and dividing the information to make it more readable.
Once that was done, all the was left was adding buttons to collapse the content and adding some extra styling to make it even easier to read.

This project was perfect for a first one, as it helped me learn how to use GET and taught me the importance of coming into a project with a basic idea of what you want it to look like.
